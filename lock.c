 * -------------------------------------------------
 * HARDWARE CONFIGURATION:
 * 
 * OUTPUTS: SERVO (GPIO 14), GREEN_LED (GPIO 15), RED_LED (GPIO 18)
 * INPUTS: PHOTODIODE (GPIO 24), BUTTON (GPIO 23)
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * PROGRAM DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * This program consists of a simple state machine 
 * that implements PIGPIO library functions to control 
 * the servo motor and a function to read the 
 * communication file stored in the shared network
 * folder. GPIO library functions are also used to
 * control the LED and button circuits. Reduced to a
 * few lines, the program running on the lock 
 * mechanism reads the current command (a ‘1’ or ‘0’ 
 * specifying locked or unlocked respectively) in 
 * commFile.txt and executes the command through a state 
 * machine that consists of four major states: START, 
 * UNLOCKED, WAITING_TO_LOCK (waiting for the door 
 * to close as detected by the photodiode) and LOCKED.
